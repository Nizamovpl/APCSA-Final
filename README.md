Hello! My name is WarpWing and I'm writing this README on behalf of Percy Nizamovpl AKA LogicalPercy. Today I'm using the power of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) to give Percy's project a extra little of pizazz so to speak.

# About the Project 
This is a project about creating a game menu in Medieval Times with a operational save function and a character selection set.
At the moment, it works but could be improved.
